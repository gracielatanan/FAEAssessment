# Function and Error

This project is about how can you use the require, assert, and revert function to fix an error. The purpose of this project is to know the logic of the code to understand the error.

## Description

This project is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a function that can check whether the number is true or false. This project serve as a simple introduction on how to understand and fix the error.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., functionanderror.sol). 

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.25" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile functionanderror.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "functionanderror" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it. Click on the "functionanderror" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the function that you have. Finally! click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the message that you insert in your function.
